What practical things works:  
- Boot rom works fully
- Some of the CPU Blargg's tests are passing as well  
- Tetris goes into the menu, is able to go through menu, but does not go into actual gameplay (probably an issue with the STOP state of CPU as PC is not changing):

What was tested but doesn't work:  
- Dr Mario game
- Super Mario game  
- Blargg tests  
  
  
*NO GAMES ARE PROVIDED*
